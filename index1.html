                    <p>Parkinson's disease is a progressive neurological disorder that affects movement. 
                        It develops gradually, often starting with a barely noticeable tremor in one hand.
                        Over time, it may also cause stiffness or slowing of movement.
                        The primary cause of Parkinson's disease is the loss of cells in the brain that produce dopamine, a neurotransmitter involved in movement control.
                        Symptoms typically appear when dopamine levels drop significantly. Besides motor symptoms, Parkinson's can also cause non-motor symptoms 
                        such as cognitive changes, mood disorders, and autonomic dysfunction.
                        While the exact cause of Parkinson's disease is not fully understood, it is believed to involve a combination of genetic and environmental factors. 
                        There is currently no cure for Parkinson's disease, but treatments such as medication, surgery, and therapy can help manage symptoms
                         and improve quality of life for people living with the condition</p>

                            <li><span></span>In Parkinson’s disease, certain nerve cells (neurons) in
                                 the brain gradually break down or die. Many of the symptoms are due to a loss of neurons that
                                  produce a chemical messenger in your brain called dopamine.

                                  The cause of Parkinson’s disease is unknown, but several factors appear to play a role, including: </li>
                            <li><span>Genes</span><br>Researchers have identified specific genetic mutations that can cause Parkinson’s disease. 
                                But these are uncommon except in rare cases with many family members affected by Parkinson’s disease.However,
                                 certain gene variations appear to increase the risk of Parkinson’s disease but with a relatively small 
                                 risk of Parkinson’s disease for each of these genetic markers.</li>
                            <li><span>Environmental triggers</span><br>Exposure to certain toxins or environmental factors may increase the risk
                                 of later Parkinson’s disease, but the risk is relatively small.</li>
                        </ul>

                            <li><span>Age</span><br>Young adults rarely experience Parkinson’s disease. It ordinarily begins in middle or 
                                late life, and the risk increases with age. People usually develop the disease around age 60 or older.</li>
                            <li><span>Heredity </span><br>Having a close relative with Parkinson’s disease increases the chances 
                                that you’ll develop the disease. However, your risks are still small unless you have many relatives 
                                in your family with Parkinson’s disease.</li>
                            <li><span>Exposure to toxins</span><br>Ongoing exposure to herbicides and pesticides may slightly increase your risk
                                 of Parkinson’s disease.</li>

                                These usually occur in the later stages of Parkinson’s disease. Such cognitive problems aren’t very responsive to medications.</li>

                                 Receiving treatment for depression can make it easier to handle the other challenges of Parkinson’s disease.
                                 You may also experience other emotional changes, such as fear, anxiety or loss of motivation. Doctors may give you 
                                 medications to treat these symptoms.</li>
                            <li><span>Sleep problems and sleep disorders</span><br>People with Parkinson’s disease often have sleep problems, 
                                including waking up frequently throughout the night, waking up early or falling asleep during the day.
                                People may also experience rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, which involves acting out your dreams. 
                                Medications may help your sleep problems.</li>

                    <p>Tremors are one of the earlier symptoms of Parkinsonism and Parkinson’s disease. 
                        There are many types of tremors, but the tremors that occur in Parkinsonism are called resting tremors,
                         meaning that they happen when a person is at rest and not performing a voluntary action.
                         These tremors typically occur in the hands and arms, but sometimes occur in the chin or legs.
                         The resting hand tremors are sometimes referred to as “pill-rolling” because it looks like the person is repeatedly
                          rolling a pill between their thumb and fingers. </p>
